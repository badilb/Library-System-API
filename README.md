# API-server book manager 
This project represent a good and simple example of using API to manage databases. First at all, I have a API that generates different tipes of books with basic information about them: author's names, year of publishing, book title etc. At the second, I connected this API with my code to work with it(see serverExpress.js file). And third task was create a API controllers to each category(author, book, genres) and do services to them. TY all who support me! =)
